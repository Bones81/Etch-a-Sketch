In this project you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy for your 
portfolio to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to 
build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an 
Etch-A-Sketch.

This project should not be easy for you. You’ll probably have to 
Google frequently to get the right JavaScript methods and CSS to 
use - in fact, that’s the point! You can build this using the 
tools that you have already learned and there are plenty of 
resources on the net for learning stuff that we haven’t covered 
yet if you decide you need it. We’ll walk you through the basic 
steps, but it will be up to you to actually implement them.

If you get totally stuck drop by the chatroom.. someone will be 
there to point you in the right direction.

---Personal Notes---
Intimidated by the them saying "this project should not be easy 
for you," I chose to practice on previous projects for a day and a 
half before starting this one. I think that was a smart decision, 
because now that I revisit the description and the particular 
steps of the assignment, it no longer looks as daunting, though 
I'm sure I'll be humbled soon enough.
